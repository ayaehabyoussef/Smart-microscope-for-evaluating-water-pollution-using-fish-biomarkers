Manual identification of water quality is a laborious process that relies heavily on experts. Water quality is measured based on biomarkers of fish or algae living in water bodies, which reflect the degree of water pollution, particularly in the context of drinking water. Since water quality testing is an important part of environmental monitoring, and poor water quality affects not only aquatic life but also the surrounding ecosystem, we decided to develop this project to determine water quality as high, medium, or low. Our application software simplifies this process by automating identification using a fish gill-based image classification technique as a biomarker, saving time and effort. This research aims to maintain the earthâ€™s ecological balance by controlling microorganisms that affect the safety of drinking water, thereby protecting the lives of all living beings. The final product aims to provide safe drinking water, free from harmful microorganisms beyond a specified threshold. Key objectives include creating and sharing an annotated database of microscopic fish gill images on platforms such as Kaggle or Mendeley Data to support research, and developing a smart microscope system model using machine learning and deep learning techniques to accurately assess water quality from fish gill microscopic images.

For the classification of water quality based on fish gill biomarkers, we experimented with four different machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector Machine with Linear kernel (SVM-L), and Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVM-RBF). The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, recall, specificity, F1-score, and precision. Among these, the SVM with RBF kernel demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving the highest accuracy (52%), recall (52%), specificity (89%), F1-score (54%), and precision (52%). This indicates that SVM(RBF) is the most effective model for classifying water quality in our study.
